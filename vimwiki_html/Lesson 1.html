<div id="Hello World"><h1 id="Hello World" class="header"><a href="#Hello World">Hello World</a></h1></div>

<p>
Hello world is a ubiqitous first program programmers often write to test out a new idea or when trying a new language.
</p>

<p>
The idea of hello world is actually quite useful and the idea is to simplify a problem as much as possible so you can have a starting point that works. For example if you have some large complicated code, you might do some small isolated hello-world type test where you rip out only the problematic code and wrench on that.
</p>

<p>
Since you are embarking on a code learning adventure it's only proper to begin with a hello world program.
</p>

<p>
For this course we'll use Python since its popular and used widely
</p>

<div id="Code"><h1 id="Code" class="header"><a href="#Code">Code</a></h1></div>

<p>
<em>hello-world.py</em>
</p>
<pre>
print("Hello world!");
</pre>

<p>
<em>output</em>
</p>

<pre>
Hello world!
</pre>

<div id="Your Turn"><h1 id="Your Turn" class="header"><a href="#Your Turn">Your Turn</a></h1></div>

<p>
Using Vim or Atom, write your hello-world.py file and add as many print statements as you want, you can use the above example as a guideline.
</p>

<p>
To run a python script, using Python 3, open a terminal and navigate to your file and then run <code>python3 hello-world.py</code>
