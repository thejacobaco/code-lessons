= Hello World =

Hello world is a ubiqitous first program programmers often write to test out a new idea or when trying a new language.

The idea of hello world is actually quite useful and the idea is to simplify a problem as much as possible so you can have a starting point that works. For example if you have some large complicated code, you might do some small isolated hello-world type test where you rip out only the problematic code and wrench on that.

Since you are embarking on a code learning adventure it's only proper to begin with a hello world program.

For this course we'll use Python since its popular and used widely

= Code =

_hello-world.py_
{{{
print("Hello world!");
}}}

_output_

{{{
Hello world!
}}}

= Your Turn =

Using Vim or Atom, write your hello-world.py file and add as many print statements as you want, you can use the above example as a guideline.

To run a python script, using Python 3, open a terminal and navigate to your file and then run `python3 hello-world.py`
